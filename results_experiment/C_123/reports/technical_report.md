## 1. Executive Summary

## 2. Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Carbon as First-Class Scheduler

**Rationale:** Renewable score is a hard scheduling gate — nodes with score < θ do not train. This transforms carbon policy from a post-hoc offset to an embedded system constraint.

### ADR-002: Renewable-Weighted FedAvg

**Rationale:** Aggregation weights scale as (samples × renewable²), amplifying influence of green nodes and creating virtuous incentive alignment.

### ADR-003: Oracle Predictive Scheduling

**Rationale:** 3-round look-ahead allows deferring training to upcoming green windows, avoiding suboptimal training during marginal renewable availability.

### ADR-004: Adaptive Learning Rate

**Rationale:** LR = base_lr × (0.5 + 0.5 × renewable_score): faster learning when energy is plentiful, conservative when operating on scarce renewables.

### ADR-005: Non-IID Dirichlet Partitioning

**Rationale:** α=0.5 Dirichlet concentration creates realistic label heterogeneity. Melbourne nodes hold only digits 0–4; Costa Rica nodes hold 5–9.

### ADR-006: Byzantine-Robust Aggregation

**Rationale:** Trimmed-mean discards top/bottom 10% of gradient updates per parameter, protecting against poisoning from compromised or outlier nodes.

### ADR-007: Server-Side Polyak Momentum

**Rationale:** Momentum buffer β=0.9 smooths the global update trajectory, accelerating convergence under sparse participation (common in carbon-gated training).

## 7. Reproduce

```bash
cd climate_fed_orchestrator

# Three-arm comparison (Standard FL / Naive CA / Oracle CA)
python main.py --mode full --rounds 10 --seed 42

# Long run, 50 rounds with cinematic visualisations
python main.py --mode full --rounds 50 --viz

# Single-arm oracle only
python main.py --mode oracle --rounds 20
```
