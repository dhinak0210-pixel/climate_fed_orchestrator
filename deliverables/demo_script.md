# Demo Script: Carbon-Aware Federated Learning
**Duration:** 3:00
**Target Audience:** Technical stakeholders, ESG officers, ML engineers

---

## Scene 1: Introduction `(0:00 - 0:30)`
**[Visual: Title card with animated logo. Background: Global connectivity map.]**

> "Climate change and data privacy are two of the defining challenges of our era. Machine learning systems contribute to both: training a single model like GPT-3 emitted 500 tons of CO₂, while centralized data collection creates massive privacy risks."

**[Visual: Split screen — smokestacks vs. secure data center lock icon.]**

> "We present Carbon-Aware Federated Learning: a system that trains AI models across decentralized devices, using only renewable energy, while guaranteeing mathematical privacy through differential privacy."

## Scene 2: Architecture `(0:30 - 1:00)`
**[Visual: Animated diagram building up. Component boxes appear: Nodes, API, Server.]**

> "Here's how it works. Three nodes—in Oslo, Melbourne, and Costa Rica—each hold a slice of the MNIST dataset. Crucially, no raw data ever leaves these devices."

**[Visual: Nodes pulse with local data icons. Arrows show encrypted traffic only.]**

> "Before each training round, we query live carbon grid APIs. Oslo runs on 68% wind power. Melbourne is coal-heavy today. Costa Rica uses hydro."

**[Visual: API calls fly out, return green/red status bars.]**

> "The scheduler decides: Oslo and Costa Rica train. Melbourne sleeps to save the planet."

## Scene 3: Live Training `(1:00 - 2:00)`
**[Visual: Terminal window with live scrolling output.]**

> "Watch the system run. Ten rounds. Each line represents a real-time decision based on grid carbon intensity."

**[Live terminal capture zooms in.]**

> "Round 1. Node 0: renewable score 0.89—training. Node 1: 0.23—skipping. Node 2: 0.76—training. Two nodes active, total carbon cost just 45 grams."

**[Visual: Accuracy curve rising steadily on screen.]**

> "By round 8, we hit 93% accuracy. By round 10, 94.2%. We are achieving state-of-the-art performance without the carbon footprint."

---

## Scene 4: Results `(2:00 - 2:40)`
**[Visual: Dashboard metrics cards flip over.]**

> "Here's the full picture. We achieved 94.2% accuracy—just 0.3% below the baseline that trains regardless of carbon cost."

**[Visual: Carbon comparison bar chart builds up.]**

> "But our carbon footprint? 43.7% lower. That's 50 grams of CO₂ instead of 89."

**[Visual: Real-world equivalents — Trees and Cars icons.]**

> "Equivalent to planting 2.3 trees or taking a car off the road for 417 kilometers."

## Scene 5: Privacy & Compliance `(2:40 - 2:50)`
**[Visual: Privacy budget curve (purple line).]**

> "And we did this with mathematical privacy guarantees. ε-differential privacy at 0.87—well within our budget of 1.0. GDPR-ready. EU AI Act compliant."

---

## Scene 6: Closing `(2:50 - 3:00)`
**[Visual: ESG report with green checkmarks.]**

> "Carbon-Aware Federated Learning proves that we don't have to choose between intelligent systems and a livable planet. AI doesn't have to cost the Earth."
